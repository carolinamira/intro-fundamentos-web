            <p class = "justify">Aerial silks, also called tissu or fabric, is a relatively new art form the origins of which are disputed. The first purported mention of it was in a small French newspaper article written in 1959.  The article reported that a student at a circus school presented an incredible act using a long piece of fabric. The act was so impressive that it gained local media attention and eventually gave rise to a whole new acrobatic discipline.</p>
            <p class = "justify">Some say that André Simard of Canada founded aerial silks.  He was appointed as the acrobatic research and development specialist at a relatively unknown, newly minted circus called Cirque du Soleil in 1987.  André Simard combined his background in Olympic level gymnastics, fine art, and clowning to come up with new, innovative ways to impress audience members with acrobatics.</p>
